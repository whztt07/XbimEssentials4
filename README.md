xBIM Essentials 2
=================

This is a part of [xBIM Toolkit](https://github.com/xBimTeam/) and will be moved there once ready for a collaborative development. It is partially generated code for EXPRESS schemas for BIM and partially refactored code from Xbim.IO and Xbim.Common. Changes made to these are substantial and it might even not compile for a while as it is under heavy development. Once done it should provide API unchanged as much as possible for other developers using xBIM while providing more flexibility to create/use different EXPRESS schemas (IFC2x3 and eventually other).
